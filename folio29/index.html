         <h1>6 Reasons Why you Should Adopt a Dog from a Shelter</h1>
           

        <h3>1. Saves a Life and Gives Dog Another Chance </h3>
        
      <div class="image-box">       
     
     <img 
          src="Images/DogHome.jpg" 
          alt="dog home"
          style= "width:900px; height:400px;"/> 
        
  
        
        </div>    
        
        <p class="reasons">All of the animals in the shelter are those who need a second chance. They have been lost, given up, or abandoned. They all are going through hard times. By adopting a dog, you are giving the dog a second chance at life in a place that they can call home with someone who cares about them.</p>
        <h3>2. Helps Fight against Puppy Mills </h3>
          <div class="image-box">       
     
     <img 
          src="Images/PuppyMill.jpg" 
          alt="Puppy Mill"
            style= "width:900px; height:400px;"/> 
        
  
        </div>    
        
        <p class="reasons"> Throughout the country, there are thousands of puppy mill facilities who repeatedly impregnate female dogs, having to spend their entire lives in cages without a home or any human companionship. They are forced to be in horrible environments, having to produce litter upon litter, and are put down after they are no use to them. Adoting a dog means you don't support these cruel facilities.</p>
        
         <h3>3. Saves the Lives of Other Animals in the Shelter </h3>
        <div class="image-box">       
     
     <img 
          src="Images/Saveotherdogs.jpg" 
          alt="Saves the lives of other animals"
             style= "width:900px; height:400px;"/> 
        
  
        
        </div>    
        
         <p class="reasons">By adopting from a shelter, this will give more room for other animals at the shelter. Not only that, but the money you pay goes directly to take better care of these animals coming in. </p>
        
        
    
        <h3>4. $aves Money </h3>
       
        <div class="image-box">       
     
     <img 
          src="Images/cashdog.jpg" 
          alt="dog with cash"
              style= "width:900px; height:400px;"/> 
        
  
        </div>    
        
        <p class="reasons">The costs of adopting an animal is much lower than buying one from a breeder who is trying to make money. Also, most animals in a shelter has already gotten all of its shots and is either spayed or neutered, which will also save you money from those medical bills. </p>
            
        <h3>5. Takes Advantage of Owning a Dog who is Already an Adult </h3>
           <div class="image-box">       
     
     <img 
          src="Images/AdultDog.jpg" 
          alt="Adult Dog"
             style= "width:900px; height:400px;"/> 
        
  
        
        </div>    
    <p class="reasons">By adopting a dog who is already an adult, you don't have to go through that "puppy phase", where they destroy everything in your house. Sometimes you don't even have to train them. Plus, you get to already see the personality of the pet. </p>
        <h3>6. Will Make Both You and Your New Friend Happy </h3>
        
        <div class="image-box">

             style= "width:900px; height:400px;"/> 
        
  
        
        </div>    
        
        <p class="reasons">Not only are you giving your pet a new place to call home, but you are also getting a new best friend who will always be there for you. You will have the good feeling of knowing that you brightened a dog's life.</p>

    <p id="About-Me">My name is Monica and I am 12 years old. I live in Hawaii with my mom, dad, and two dogs. I got my first dog when I was 8 years old, when she was a puppy. Her name is Mini Mo, and is a miniature pinsher. She is now 5 years old. She went through some hard times, but survived through it all. However, this caused her to get separation anxiety. So as a result, we recently decided to get a second dog to keep her company whenever we leave. His name is Poi, and is a terrier mix. We got this dog from the humane society this year and is 2 years old. We were first a bit hesistant of getting him due to the fact that we are already his fourth family due to a bunch of different situations, but we decided to take a chance on him. When we first got him, he was very timid, scared, skinny, and barely knew what a toy is. However, after only a month, he is a whole different dog. He plays every day, loves to snuggle, and sometimes even gets himself into some trouble. He is a perfect fit for our family and keeps Mini Mo company. However, while we were looking for another dog, I noticed how many dogs come and go out of the shelter. There are dogs who have stayed in the shelter for months or even years. It kind of opened my eyes to see this. I saw how much Poi changed after being with a loving family, and feel that all dogs should get another chance and have this as well. This is why I created this site, to show people why adopting a dog is important and how it can change your life.  </p>
