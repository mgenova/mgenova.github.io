        <div id="mainparagraph"><h1 id="title">About Peacocks</h1><p>Peacocks are basically male peafowls, while peahens are women peafowls. Peacocks are omnivores (both a carnivore and herbivore) they eat both plants and other animals (like insects). Peacocks are mostly known for their beautiful brightly colored feathers that alsmost look like eyes (which is kind of creepy but still cool). Peacocks actually have tiny crystal-like structures between each of their feathers. These crystal-like stuctures bend and reflect light in attractive ways, which makes the bird more striking and vibrant. All peacocks can actually fly, which amazed me at first since there so big. They are actually one of the most biggest birds that can fly, reaching up to 5 feet in length (including their tail). If you see one in person (which you probably have) its pretty big and when I was younger I thought it couldn't fly and its tail was to big and heavy for it too, but then I saw it fly. Peacocks do fly up to trees and roost on there which makes sense because when I was younger and thought it couldn't fly I was like where does it sleep? Does it sleep under trees, in a cave of somesort, or does it make its own pen? But then I found out the truth when I saw it roosting in a tree and (when I was younger) I saw it on the tree before I knew or saw it fly, so I was pretty confused as to how it got up there. One other thing about Peacocks is that they go crazy for food (which I can relate) and love it. Once you feed them food they keep wanting more and just all in all like and basially beg for food (which is kind of annoying at sometimes but I guess thats how my Mom feels about me). In my neigborhood, when we fed the peacock, it always loved food and always wanted a lot and basically begged for more, and I was like... is that just this peacock or are all peacocks like this. Turns out, when I searched it on the web, they are all like that. Well...I think all ceatures and animals like food. Peacocks actually originated from India and turns out humans kept blue peacocks as pets for thousands of years.</p><h2 id="tale">The Tale of the Peacock Rain Dance</h2><p>The tale of the peacock rain dance is basically a tale that people believed for centuries and still do. Its about how peacocks tend to dance (shake their feathers) before rain comes. They belived that they can fortell when rain would come. This though is not scientifically proven, people have experienced them dancing before rain came. But scientist believe its just a coincidence and that the peacocks were just at the right place, at the right time (which kind of sucks because I was hoping it was real).</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jz-tjJhFH1k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Other cool videos - <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBP3VdW9d7k">Flying Peacock</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDS_rM4Qlh4">Slomo of Peacock Flying</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_jlc7k-JfA">Peacock vs Rooster (This is kind of funny)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBAJlnkMzVo">Peacock Battle (At 2:37 your gonna see a rooster come out of nowhere and I think he wanted to to watch the insane fight)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0_CFjOURic">Peacock Spreading its  Feathers (Sorry if quality is kind of bad)</a></li></p></div>
