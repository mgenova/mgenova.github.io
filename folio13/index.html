          <p> I flew to Washington D.C. for the Youth Capture the Colorful Cosmos Summit. I was chosen from my classmates of an Astrophotography Workshop at the Pacific Aviation Museum. Along with the summit, I was able to explore a few of the many museums and sites scattered around the area. </p>

        <p>The Capitol during the day! You can see the needle in the center of the dome.    (day1)</p>

      <div class="container">
        <p>Off to the metro! I took the metro to the National Building Museum. This is the Judiciary Square Station sign. </p>

    <div class="polaroid">
      <img src="WashingtonDCMetroinside.JPG" alt="WashingtonDC" style="width:100%">
      <div class="container">
        <p> The inside of the metro station was semi-circular with concrete blocks all along the ceiling. It was such interesting architecture!   </p>

        <p>Yay! The National History Museum! This is the outside view.    </p>

      <img src="WashingtonDCNationalBuildingMuseum2.JPG" alt="WashingtonDC" style="width:100%">
      <div class="container">
        <p> This is a view of the ceiling in the National Building Museum. Up in the little arches, there were sculptures of our former presidents' busts.   </p>

      <div class="container">
        <p>Panorama! This panorama was taken of the whole inside building. This is NOT the regular inside! The pillars were huge and so beautifully designed. I felt tiny against their massiveness!         </p>
      </div>

     <div class="polaroid">
      <img src="WashingtonDCNationalArchivesBuilding.JPG" alt="WashingtonDC" style="width:100%">
      <div class="container">
        <p>This is the National Archives Building at night. I wasn't able to go inside, hence the reason for no other pictures. But, the lights illuminated the outside, giving me the ability to take this picture.  (End of day1)   </p>

        <p>This is the outside view National History Museum. This photo was taken in the entrance of the Smithsonian Castle. (day2)   </p>

      <img src="WashingtonDCSmithsonianCastle.JPG" alt="WashingtonDC" style="width:100%">
      <div class="container">
        <p>The Smithsonian Castle! You can see the flag containing the symbol up on the roof. The castle inside had an old, vintage feel but still somewhat modern. As you may have realized, the castle is across from the Natural History Museum.    </p>

    <div class="polaroid">
      <img src="WashingtonDCWashingtonMonument.JPG" alt="WashingtonDC" style="width:100%">
      <div class="container">
        <p>The Washington Monument! The pencil shape causes an illusion of it piercing through the sky. You cannot tell it's real height from this photo, but it was giant! Washington D.C. can get pretty cloudy and this was taken on one of those days.  </p>
