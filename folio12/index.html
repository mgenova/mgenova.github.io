    <p>You see I'm perfectly responsible. It's not me who had the problem. Tommy Thompson however, he is where the problem lies! I had seven color-coded pencils, but Edgar Yambottom he lost them ALL! So when there was only 1 more pencil in the borrow box the race was on with Tommy ... He never brings a pencil, or anything for that matter! Including his brain ...   </p>

    <p>Tommy got the pencil before i could get to it, but I swore to myself that I would get my <strong>revenge</strong>.</p>

    <p>Finaly I had had enough. I challenged him to a football game. If I win Tommy has to get me a new whole box of #2 pencils, and if he wins I have to give him my jello for a whole week.  </p>
