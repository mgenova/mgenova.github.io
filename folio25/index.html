        <p class="Jaguars Are Awesome"> Jaguars are in the cat family. They like to climb and live in trees. They are great swimmers and love to swimm. I tink they look very cool especially when they are running. They eat meant and other animals. The animals that they eat are deer, monkeys, sloths, alagators, snakes, and many more. I find it very interesting that they can eat aligators, because anigators are big, fast, and strong. It shows you just how awesome Jaguars are. Here is a website on <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/j/jaguar/">National Geographic</a> about Jaguars. </p>
