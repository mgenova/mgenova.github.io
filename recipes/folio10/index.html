        <h1>Krispy Kreme Donut Dab</h1>
      <p>This is a donut recipie for my own donut recipe. Okay it's not original. It is from Krispy Kreme, but I like them so i'll show you how to make them without needing coffe.</p>
      
      <h1>Ingrediants</h1>
<ul>

  <li>2 (1/4 ounce) packages yeast
<lil> 1⁄4 cup water</lil>
<li>1 1⁄2 cups lukewarm milk<li/>  
  <li>1⁄2 cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1⁄2 cup shortening</li>
  <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>canola oil</li>
  <li>brown sugar</li>
  <li>cinimon</li>
</ul> 
  <h1>Directions</h1>
 <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in 2 1/2-quart bowl.<li/>
<lil> Add milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening and 2 cups flour.</lil>
<li>Beat on low for 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly<li/>  
  <li>Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally.</li>
  <li>Stir in remaining flour until smooth</li>
  <li>Cover and let rise until double, 50-60 minutes or over night. This will be a long sleep for the dough.</li>
  <li>Once dough is risen, take out the dough and place it on flour.</li>
  <li>Gently roll dough 1/2-inch thick with floured rolling pin.</li>
  <li>Cut with floured doughnut cutter. If you have left over dough, roll out again. Or you could have a little sneak of dough.</li>
  <li>Cover and let rise until double, 30-40 minutes.This covering is like a cat nap.</li>
  <li>Onece the dough has risen more, heat vegatinle oil to fry.</li>
  <li>Slide in donuts and cook both sides. Put of rack to drain them. I personally like to then put them on a paper towl after draining them, just to make sure the grease has drainded more.</li>
  <li>Put 1/4 of cugar and 3 tablespoons of cinimon. Shake donuts in a bag with this mixture.</li>    
</ul> 
    <p>And you are done! Now you can stuff your face with donuts and show your friends you can bake.</p>
