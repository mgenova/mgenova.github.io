            <li>2 tablespoons salted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 packed cup plus 2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 package crescent roll dough</li>
            
            <h3>Glaze</h3>
            <li>2 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>

            <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Use a pastry brush to lightly coat the insides of a small casserole dish with some of the melted butter, about one teaspoon. Set the butter aside. In a separate bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Pop the crescent roll dough canister and carefully unravel dough into a long rectangular shape, careful not to tear the perforated markings. Use a pastry brush to lightly coat the dough with some of the melted butter, about one teaspoon or more, leaving a 1/4-inch border free of any butter. Then sprinkle the top of dough with the cinnamon sugar mixture, leaving the 1/4-inch borders free of sugar. Spread sugar evenly around the dough using a plastic bowl scraper, and then press it into the dough using a fork or your fingers. Drizzle the remaining melted butter on top of the sugar mixture until partially saturated.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into a tight log. Slice it into eight even pieces (about 1/2 inch thick). Using a bench scraper or a spatula (so the cinnamon sugar does not pour out), transfer the dough pieces into a prepared baking dish and place them cut side up. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until dough begins to turn golden brown on top.</li>
            <li>While rolls are baking, combine butter and cream cheese together in a mixer, then whip in lemon juice and vanilla. Add powdered sugar and mix until fully incorporated. Using a spatula, spread the glaze evenly over cinnamon rolls. Place any leftover glaze in a bowl to serve on the side.</li>
            <li>Enjoy these sinfully gooey treats, whether your hosting a party, or just eating them all by yourself.</li>
