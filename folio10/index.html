<p id="Spinosaurus"<strong>This picture is of a spinosaurus this dinosaur can get up to 41-59ft in hight it is huge so I suggest you run!!! if you happen to run into one
                   which I am pretty sure they should be right about scrary to most humans.</strong></p>

  <P <strong> <header>This is a picture of a dinosaur we like to call a tyrannosaurus rex</header> but for short we can call it a T-rex like most people do because it is 
                            easier to say I also wanted to say that this dinosaur has a really strong jaw to it could eat any thing in about 2.7 seconds if it wanted 
                      to it can get up to 40-43ft tall but it's hight isn't what gets him/her dinner his/her huge jaw does.It is also a meat eater so I would suggest you 
         run if you happen to see this dinosaur walking around in 2015.</strong></p>

 <p class="T-rex"<strong>This is a picture of a stegosaurus a stegosaurus isn't a meat eater so they might not chase you until you can't breath I am not going to tell you
    that they are not going to chase you but there is a less chance they can get up to 30ft in height so not as big as the others but they can get a lot bigger than most
               humans!!</strong > 
                  <li>Pteranodon</li>

                          <p<strong>This is a dinosaur that can fly just like peter pan and this dinosaur is a meat eater but most of the time they go after fish in the
               ocean so us humans are okay until the ocean runs out of fish which I ma pretty sure wont happen this huge flying peter pan can get up to 6ft in height which
               isn't that big but I am sure if this thing starts to chase you you will probably freek out!!

         <p <strong>This is one of the many different dinosaurs with the really long necks this type of dinosaur is not a meat eater so lucky for us tiny humans we wont
                    be there dinner yay so yeah it is a good thign they are vegetarians  but this dinosaur can get to about 30ft fall or more so lets just say watch were
                    you are stepping brachiosaurus so you do squish me.</strong>  
                    <li>ankylosaurus</li>

               <p<strong>This dinosaur is luckly a  vegetarian as well so not to much worrying we have to do but in some ways this dinosaur can be very dangerous this
    dinosaur can get to  25-35 feet (7.5-10.7 m) long in length and 4 ft (1.2 m) tall at the hips in in height and  3-4 tons in Weight so yes these are very heavy don't 
    let them squish you it will hurt</strong>
