            <h2> Basic Favorites</h2>
        <p> 
        I like the colors purple, red and black. I don't have a favorite thing to eat. I do like to eat desserts, candy, sweet things, local favorites and a lot more things that im not going to name. I like to wear jeans and tank tops, 
        I also like the clothes that my relatives in California give me, :). If I were to live somewhere, I would live in Hawaii, Colorado, or California. I have traveled to many places. I've been to California, Hollywood, Las Vegas, 
        Colorado, Pennsylvania, Maui, and the Big Island. I would like to travel to Florida,New York and New Zealand. My favorite sport is soccer. I would like to be on a team, but my mom thinks that it is a little too dangerous for 
        her taste. I also like to run, swim, scatterball, shambattle, and games that are similar to softball and baseball. My favorite season is winter.<strong> I also like snow and things that are cold, like ice cream and shave ice
        </strong>. I like going to the beach, playing with my friends, going to the park, playing video games, playing on my computer, doing arts and crafts, and lots of other things. My best friends are Ho'opili, Chelsea, and Juan. 
        Other close friends are Ava, Quinn, Sierra, Erick, and Isabella. My favorite character for anything, is the stickman, because it is a basic character and isn't too fancy. I have a fascination in tribal designs, infinity signs, 
        anchors, and Shadow Hunter runes. For those of you who do not know what Shadow Hunters are, you should read the books, or search it up on the web. I like to paint, color and create new things. When I grow up, I would like to be 
        a lot of things. A lawyer,fashion designer,pilot,maybe a personal trainer, and some other things. I consider myself to be smart, talented, a problem solver, caring, a little mean, weird, funny, creative, and a quality producer. 
        I like to daydream, or as my parents say, go to lala land. I have a very, active imagination. My mom thinks that maybe I can put my imagination to work and become a writer. I like to try new things. I would like to go snowboarding, 
        skydiving, skiing, and some other things that may be scary, but are really fun. My favorite subject is Computer Literacy, and P.E. If I had art class, that would be one of my favorite subjects. I also want to try dance choreography.

        <p id="beach-background"> This is supposed to be the second page for my project, but since I cant have another page, ill just have to improvise.
        I like to do a lot of things on the computer. I also like to do many things at once, for example, I will listen to music, chat, and read at the same time. I like
        listening to Eric Clapman, because he does a lot of remixes. My favorite remix that he created is the Best Remixes Dance Mix 5 (2015). I also like to watch a lot of movies. My favorite kind of movies, are horror movies. Lately, I have 
        been watching the Final Destination Series. My favorite TV series is Scream and Scream Queens. I love to read books. I have read a lot of genres, but my favorite genre is, Young Adult, or adventure. One of my classmates
        made this website, where you can play a couple of games, but its something that was made from this website also. I think that it is pretty cool that he could make
        it, so ill show you a little bit of it. <ul>
