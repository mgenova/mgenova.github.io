    <p style="color:white"> Hi welcome to my first webpage! This web page is all about being weird. I personally love the word Weird. Some people use the word weird as something that is bad or something insulting. But to me weird means that you're different and unique. And being unique and having individuality is a very good quality to have. I mean would you want to be one of those random faces in the yearbook or someone just like everyone else. You don't want clones of 1 person. I want to be an individual not a clone not a random face in the yearbook. So be unique, individual, and WEIRD!!
