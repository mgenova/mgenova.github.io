        <p id="introduction">My name is Isabela Hutter and here is a little about me.</p>
        

        <h2 id = "first-heading"> What People Call Me</h2>
    
        <p id = "first-paragraph">People call me by various different names, all of which I respond to. Some people call me Isabela but I most commonly go by Bela. The choice is yours. If you encounter some of my friends from Diamond Head Theatre, you might hear them call me Baela. It is something that my friend Rylie made up because once, we were in a show together and there was an Isabel, an Isabella, and me. She then decided that Isabel would be Izzy, Isabella would be Isabella, and somehow in her mavelous brain she came up with Baela for me. </p>
        
        <h3 id = "second-heading"> Theatre</h3>
   <p id = "second-paragraph">I do theatre at Diamond Head Theatre. I am a member of the Diamond Head Shooting Stars, a group of kids from ages 7-17 that do Singing Dance and Tap. We perform all over the island and rehearse once a week on Saturdays from 1:00pm - 5:00pm. I also do shows at Diamond Head. So far, I have been in
       Billy Elliot the Musical, A Christmas Carol the Musical, and I am currently in Evita. It will open on March 24, 2017 and close on April 16, 2017.</p>

       
    <h4 id = "fourth-heading">Books and TV Shows</h4>
 <p id = "fourth-paragraph"> Like everyone else, I enjoy a good read or episode to pass the time. I absolutely love Rick Riordan's series. Some series by him include Percy Jackson and the Olympians, The Heroes of Olympus, The Kane Chronicles, The Magnus Chase Series, The Trials of Apollo, and a series he is working on, Demigods and Magicians. I also love Harry Potter, The Fault in Our Stars, The Book Thief, and many many other books. Some TV shows that I enjoy are Gilmore Girls, Arrow, The Flash, Agents of S.H.E.I.L.D, Supernatural, Naruto, How I Me Your Mother, The Garfield Show, and a few others. </p>
        
        <h5 id = "fifth-heading"> Food</h5>
    <p id = "fifth-paragraph"> One last little thing about me is the type of food I like. I love Brazilian food its simply amazing. Every meal is so filling and everything is cooked to perfection. I also have a sweet tooth. I love all sorts of Brazilian deserts but I also love candy, ice cream and shave ice. My mom wants to keep me healthy so I normally don't have junk food or fast food but those are things that I can live without plus it keeps me fit!</p>
