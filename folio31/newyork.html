        <h1>New York</h1>
        <p>
        
            Even though my vacation to New York was short, my family and I were able to experience many spectacular things and see many cool buildings and structures.
            
         </p> 
            
            <h3>Day 1</h3>
        
        <p>
            
        On the first day of our New York trip, we went to the see the Statue of Liberty. We went on a boat tour to Liberty Island, where the Statue of Liberty is. 
            
        </p>
        
       
    
     <div class="image-box">
        
            <img src="Images/statueoflibertyfront.png" alt="Statue of Liberty Front" style="width:250px;height:500px;">
        
         <span>
    
            <img src="Images/statueoflibertyback.png" alt="Statue of Liberty Back" style="width:300px;height:500px;">
    
        </span> 
         
        </div> 
    
    <p>
    
        We then rode on the boat to Ellis Island, where we learned about the original immigrant experience to the United States. We also took a genealogy test to find out where our ancestors were from, and a United States history test.
        
    </p>
    
     <div class="image-box">
        
            <img src="Images/ellisisland.jpg" alt="Ellis Island" style="width:280px;height:400px;">
        
        </div> 
    
    <p>
    
       After a walk through Battery Park, we visited the World Trade Center and 9/11 Memorial and Museum. 
    
    </p>
    
     <div class="image-box">
        
            <img src="Images/worldtradecenter.jpg" alt="World Trade Center" style="width:200px;height:390px;">

    <img src="Images/flagnineleven.jpg" alt="Flag 911" style="width:650px;height:390px;">
    
    </span>
        
        </div> 
   
     
    
    <p>
    
      We then later went to the Majestic Theatre on Broadway. There, we saw "The Phantom of the Opera". The show was fabulous and everyone in it was so talented. We even received a backstage tour afterwards, because the percussion player was my mom's good friend. It was cool to see how much work and props were put into the show.
    
    </p>

    </span>
        
        </div> 
  
    
    <h3>Day 2</h3>
    
    <p>
    
    To start off our second day, we took the subway to the Metropolitain Museum of Art. The artwork in this museum ranged from ancient statues, to classic paintings, to beauitful mosaics, and modern abstract art. 
    
    </p>
    
     <div class="image-box">
        
    <img src="Images/metinterior.JPG" alt="Metropolitan Museum of Art Interior" style="width:400px;height:300px;">

    </span>
        
        </div> 
    
    <h3>Day 3</h3>
    
    <p>
    
    The first thing we did on day 3 was go to Times Square. It was awesome to see so many people, advertissements, news announcements, and tall buildings in one place.
    
    </p>
    
     <div class="image-box">
        
            <img src="Images/timesquare.JPG" alt="Times Square" style="width:660px;height:400px;">
        
        </div> 
    
    <p>
    
    Next, we went to Rockefeller Center, which is right next to Radio City Music Hall. While we were in Rockefeller Center, we went up to the "Top of the Rock" observation deck, where we could see New York for miles and miles. After that, we went back down and went shopping around the area, and we ate at Junior's Deli.
