        <h1>Orlando</h1>
        <p>
        Orlando is famous for its theme parks, and that is what my family and I did for the entire time we were there. There were so many activities to do, games to play, and rides to ride. If you are planning to go to Universal Studios Orlando, one thing I recommend is for you to bring a change of clothes or a poncho because of the water rides (at the regular parks, not the water parks. Wear a swimsuit at the water parks). Also, wear comfortable shoes because there is a lot of walking involved. Another thing you should consider is buying and express pass, which can get you through lines faster. If you don't get an express pass, I recommend bringing something to do while you are in the lines (on your phone you can do charades, quizzes, take photos, etc.) 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        
        <p>
        
        On Day 1, we went to Volcano Bay. Volcano Bay is one of the three main Universal Parks, but unlike the other two, it is a water park. It is made to have an island theme, with Hawaiian music and palm trees everywhere. Even the rides' names were Hawaiian. Some of the rides were more mellow, while others were more agressive. The most thrilling ride is actually inside the volcano. You stand on top of the platform at the top of the volcano, then the floor comes out underneath you, and you drop 125 feet!
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
        The cool thing about Volcano Bay is that the workers there give you a watch (called a TapuTapu), that is sensitive to many different buzzers all of the park. When you press the face of your TapuTapu on, let's say a restaurant buzzer, you are able to buy food. You can unlock and lock your locker, hold your spot in lines, and even make fountains spout water with your TapuTapu.
        
        </p>
        
        
        
        <p>
        
         There were no pictures allowed inside the actual park, but below is a picture of the main volcano that I took from the outside.

        <h3>Day 2</h3>
        
        <p>
        
        On Day 2, we went to to Harry Potter sections of the other two parks. The thing is, a train called the "Hogwarts Express" takes you from one park to another. 
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
        When you walk into the Harry Potter land in the first park, you are in the town of Hogsmeade, where you can purchase different things from the shops and eat from the restaurants, which serve mostly British food. 
        
        </p>
        
        <div class="image-box">
        
            <img src="Images/hogwartshogsmeadesign.jpg" alt="Hogwarts and Hogsmeade Sign" style="width:500px;height:350px;">
         
        </div> 
        
        <p>
            
        The first Harry Potter ride in this park is a minor roller coaster called "The Flight of the Hippogriff". Both the line and the ride is designed to be as if you were in a forest (The Forbidden Forest). This ride is more geared towards people aged 5-12, but anyone 39" or more tall can ride. If you are 39"-48" tall, you must be accompanied by a supervising companion, which can be anyone 14 years or older. 
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
        
        The next ride, called "Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey" is actually inside of Hogwarts, the castle. When you start out the line, you must store all of your bags, valueables, hats, etc. in your own locker in the locker room. Then, you must take a single rider route or a regular route. If you are a single rider, that means that you will be put into any car in the ride, all by yourself. The whole line runs through the castle, winding through rooms such as Dumbledore's office, the Herbology room, etc. The ride is a simulation, but it goes through real rooms as well. You must be 48" to ride this ride. 
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
        
        Below is a video of some of the actors and actresses from the Harry Potter movies visiting the Harry Potter land in the first park.
            
            
        
        </p>
        
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rr4zIpqrro4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <p>
        
        We then took the hogwarts express from the first park, whose station is designed to be like that of Hogsmeade, to the second park, whose station is designed to be like that of King's Cross, which is an actual station in London as well.
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
        
        Once you've reached King's Cross, you must search for Diagon Alley, which is behind a brick wall. Inside Diagon Alley, there are many stores and attractions as well. You can take a turn to Knockturn Alley, which is a smaller, darker alley, with stores also. Everything is exactly how it is in the movies. There is even a dragon on top of the Gringotts bank, which breathes fire occasionally.
        
        </p>

        </div>
        
        <p>
        
        The one and only ride inside of Diagon Alley is called, "The Escape From Gringotts". This is another simulation and real ride as well. This ride is geared towards people aged 8 and above, but again, anyone that is at least 42" can ride. Children aged 42"-48" must go with a supervising companion, who must be 14 years or older. If you don't have an express pass, I highly recommend that if you are riding by yourself, or don't care about sitting together with other people, GO IN THE SINGLE RIDER line. From experience, it is A LOT faster than going the the regular line. The first time, when I went with my family in the regular line, it took 2 hours, and it wasn't even summer. The single rider line took me about 5 minutes-45 minutes. 
        
        </p>
        
        <h3>Day 3</h3>
        
        <p>
        
        On Day 3, we explored the non-Harry Potter parts of the two parks. This included rides and attractions such as Jurassic Park, Dr. Suess, Marvel, King Kong, The Simpsons, Despicable Me, Men in Black, Transformers, etc. 
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
        
        One of the cutest rides in both of these parks was the Despicable Me, Minion Mayhem. It is a simulation 3-d ride, where you wear 3-d goggles and view a large screen. This ride is geared for people aged 4-12, but anyone can ride that is 40" or taller. Children that are 40"-48" must go along with a supervising companion (must be 14 years or older). This is such an adorable family ride, I recommend it for any families with children, or anyone who likes Despicable Me.
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
        
        "Race through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon" was one of my favorite rides. Set in the "New York" of Universal, it is a simulation 3-d ride as well, where you wear 3-d goggles. You must be 40" or taller to ride. Children that are 40"-48" must go along with a supervising companion (must be 14 years or older), just like the Minion Mayhem. Again, it is a great family ride, very realistic to the Jimmy Fallon show at NBC. 
        
        </p>
        
          <div class="image-box">

        <p>
        
        After the Jimmy Fallon ride, we watched a parade of floats related to the Universal rides, that is actually directly in front of the "NBC" building. It is in the area of "New York". Rides include Secret Life of Pets, Minions, etc.
