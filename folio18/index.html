            Surfboards are a amazing work of art, and it takes many hours to make one, and perfect it.
           A skilled surfboard shaper will take extra pains to make it how they want it.
            There are many types of surboards, the gun, the shortboard, the soft top, and many others, so a shaper has many options to what he wants to make. If he is shaping for a customer order, he will customize it to the customers satisfaction. If they want a gun (a board for big waves to manuvere through barrels quickly) , the shaper knows that they surf big waves, so he can narrow down the width of the board, the thickness, and so on. There are many types of tails for a board. There are pin tails, swallow tails, squash tails, square tails, fish tails, and many others. The different types of tail are meant for different purposes. In this case, the shaper would want to make the tail of the gun a pin tail. This is because a pin tail helps to hold the board down on a wave going really fast.

        How To Make A Surfboard:
        </h2>
        
        <p>
        There are many types of boards and many techniques to make a surfboard, but with a few tools you can make any type you want. Here is the rough outline of making a basic surfboard:
            <ol>
  <li>Decide on a surfboard design</li>
  <li>Make a stringer</li>
  <li>Glue stringer between block foam</li>
  <li>Remove bulk foam from block foam</li>
  <li>Rough shape the blank</li>
  <li>Cut out rough shape of the surfboard</li>
  <li>Shape the blank</li>
  <li>Artwork if desired</li>
  <li>Fiberglassing/Laminating</li>
  <li>Hot coat and sanding the hot coat</li>
  <li>Gloss coat and sanding the gloss coat</li>
  <li>Polish</li>
  <li>Go Surfing!</li>
        </ol>
            In case you didn't get all of that, here is some terminology:
        <ul>
        <li>Blank= a rough piece of foam to be used to make a surfboard</li>
            <li>Stringer = wooden piece of wood that runs through the middle of the surfboard</li>
        <li>Glassing or Laminating = Covering the surfboard with fiberglass and resin</li>
            <li>Hot-Coat = a coat of resin applied over the glassed surfboard</li>
            <li>Gloss-Coat = a coat of resin applied over the sanded hot-coat</li>
            <li>Bulk foam and block foam = two types of foam that make up the main part of the surfboard</li>
        
        </ul>
