        <h1>Las Vegas</h1>
        <p>
        
           Even though it doesn't seem like Las Vegas is a place for children, there are still many, many fun activites that are child-geared, that many people do not know about. I recommend bringing clothes that will keep you cool, if you plan to go during summer, because temperatures can reach 117 on hot days. In winter, bring clothes that will keep you warm, because it can get cold, at an average around 50 degrees on a winter day.

        <h3>Where we Stayed: Paris Las Vegas</h3>
        
        <p>
        
        My family and I stayed at a hotel called the Paris Las Vegas on Las Vegas Blvd (The Strip). It has an "Eiffel Tower" that is half the size of the one in Paris, France. It also has a mini "Arc de Triomphe" and a small Paris hot air balloon. 
            
        <div class="image-box">

        </div>
        
        <p>
            
        The hotel has a lobby that is designed to look like Paris, with many cool restaturants, cafes, and gift shops. There is even an attraction where you can go up to the top of the "Eiffel Tower", and you can see all of Las Vegas from above. 
        
        </p>

         <p>
        
        From our hotel room, we could watch the Bellagio fountain show, which was across from the Paris Las Vegas. The hotel's pool is very big, and fancy, with columns dotted around the circular shaped water.

        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        
        <p>
        
        On day 1 of my Las Vegas vacation, my family and I went to the Mini Gran Prix Family Fun Center. There are many fun rides, including 4 go-kart and grand prix tracks for both kids and adults, plus an arcade, food party room, etc.
            
        </p>

        <div class="image-box">
        
          <img src="Images/minigranprix.jpg" alt="Go Kart" style="width:550px;height:390px;">

          </span>
        
        </div>
        
        <p>
        
        We then went to the Bellagio Conservatory, where there are many gorgeous, gigantic floral arrangments/floats.
        
        </p>
        
          <div class="image-box">

        </div>
        
        <p>
        
        After this, we walked up to our room and watched the Bellagio Fountain show. It is a series of fountains, in different shapes and lines, in the middle of the water. It goes to different music every time, classic, Italian, or even pop/hip-hop. It happens about every 30 minutes.
        
        </p>

        <h3>Day 2</h3>
        
        <p>
        
        We started off our second day in Las Vegas by going to Circus Circus, which is an amusement park and hotel. There are many fun roller coasters, rides, games, performances, etc. We also ate at a buffet, which is right in the hotel lobby.
            
        </p>
        
        <div class="image-box">

        </div>
        
        <p>
        
        After this, we went to the Las Vegas Golden Knights Hockey game at T-Mobile Arena. My brother plays and is obsessed with hockey, so of course we HAD to go. The rink is actually pretty big, and there is a huge jumbotron in the middle of it.
        
        </p>
        
         <div class="image-box">

        </div>
        
        <h3>Day 3</h3>
        
        <p>
        
        To start off our third day, we went to a very awesome, sustainable pakr/mall called the Las Vegas Container Park. The ENTIRE park is made out of shipping containers. In the front, there are a couple of cool, huge structures. In the middle, there is a children's playground. On the sides, there are three floors of shopping and eating. This is such a splendid place for practically anyone at anytime.
        
        </p>

        </div>
        
        <p>
        
        We then went to a Cirque Du Soleil show, called "Beatles Love" at the Mirage. This was an AMAZING show, with many cool props, and it was all dedicated to the Beatles. Their songs were played during the show, while we watched dancers, acrobats, etc.
        
        </p>
