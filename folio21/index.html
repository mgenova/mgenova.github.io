        <h3 id = "second-heading"> Dog #1</h3>
   <p id = "second-paragraph">Ok so I've got two dogs. Let's talk about the first one.  This is Spam. *What everyone is thinking*, "Isn't Lana vegetarian? Why is her dog's name Spam?" Well...that's a long story but let's just say I didn't have "FULL" control over her name. Spam is a pekingese shih-tzu, she's a mixed breed. Fun fact: A month ago she was diagnosed with glaucoma and she had to get her one of her eyes removed recently.  I won't be including pictures of her with one eye because it's still healing (aka still kinda gross).</p>

 <p id = "fourth-paragraph"> This is my second dog.  Her name is Cookie.  I realize that both of my dogs are named after food.  Why? I have no idea ;-;.  Anyways, Cookie is a shih-tzu maltese, also a mixed breed.  She likes to destroy everything in sight so don't be fooled by her looks. Fun fact: Cookie is much larger than Spam.  However, she is a year younger than Spam.  </p>

That's okay though.| Is this website supposed to look like the Supreme logo because I'm basic? Maybe.|  Does that automatically make this website even cringier?  Forsure, 100%.|</p>
