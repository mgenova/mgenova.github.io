        <h2 id = "first-heading"> About Vine...</h2>
      <p id = "first-paragraph">Now I know what your thinking. "Maile, isn't Vine dead?" Well yes. Yes it is. But, lets just talk about Vine for a second here. Vine was a very famous social media that started in 2012 and sadly ended in early January of 2017. And in Vine, users could share six-second-long looping video clips that were mostly full of things from priceless humor and laughs, the funniest of animals, and the most random and even extremely stupid thing that anyone could do yet it was still funny. And back then, anything posted on vine was classified as comedy or entertainment, and I mean ANYTHING.</p>    
        
        <h3 id = "second-heading"> About Viners...</h3> 
         <p id = "second-paragraph"> Up at the top, you can see images of only a few of my absolute favorite Viners. And its not only those specific people. There were millions of users on vine, a couple becoming very famous. And because vine is dead *tears*, many of these people are now posting videos on YouTube and have gained millions of subscribers and still are keeping the world entertained with their comedy, skits, videos, AND WHATEVER ELSE IS ON YOUTUBE THESE DAYS. Hey, see if you can name the Viners at the top as well.</p>
        
       <h4 id = "third-heading">  About New Vine...</h4> 
        <p id = "third-paragraph">Vine never gets old. No matter how many times you watch the videos. Whether it's animals fooling around and being clumsy or its the ultimate pun coming from Liza Koshy (second Viner to the left) AKA BEST VINER EVER *cough* *cough* my opinion but she is the best *cough*.  And guess what?...THERE COMING OUT WITH VINE 2!!!!!!!!!! *scream* IM SO EXCITED!!!!!! I can't wait for all the new content, funny skits, puns, and the latest dumb videos they will come out with next!/p>
    
          <h5 id = "fourth-heading"> Warning about Vine...</h5> 
         <p id = "fourth-paragraph">If you want to check out Vine, then just look up "Vines" on YouTube and I swear, you click on the right video compilation and you will laugh your head off. *WARNING: SOME VINES CONTAIN STRONG LANGUAGE THAT I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU NOT WATCH UNLESS YOU ARE NOT SENSITIVE TO HARSH LANGUAGE...I STILL SAY YOU SHOULDN'T WATCH THEM THOUGH. I RECOMMEND ANIMAL VINES FOR STARTERS OR JUST LOOK UP "Clean Vines"*</p>
