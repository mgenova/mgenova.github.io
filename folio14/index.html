     Welcome to my art gallery! All of the art on this page are products of my imagination. I first started drawing when I was 4-ish. It was a chaotic finger painting. But despite the appearence of my picture, art fasinated me! I kept on practicing, from that day. I would draw on all kinds of things, from paper, to underneath my mom's dining table (Which she was NOT to happy about.) Soon, my dad got me an art application called Sketchbook Express on our computer. At first, I was a bit rusty. Ok, I was really bad with drawing on the computer. I still would draw on paper, but I would keep trying on the computer. Years flew by, and I guess you could say I became an ametuer digital artist! This site diplays some of my "masterpieces."<br><br></div></td>
